                <h2>Problem Statement: Time Management </h2>
                <p> People are too overwhelmed with their schedules and can’t keep up with their responsibilities. They arrive late to their appointments because they can’t time how long it takes them to get there. They feel like they have little free time when in reality they’re just managing their time poorly and wasting much of it.
